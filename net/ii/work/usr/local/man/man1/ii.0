       ii - irc it or irc improved


DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       iiii  is a minimalistic FIFO and filesystem based IRC client.  It creates
       an irc directory tree with server, channel and nick  name  directories.
       In  every  directory  a  FIFO  file  (in)  and and normal file (out) is
       placed. This will be for example ~/irc/irc.freenode.net/.  The in  file
       is  used to communicate with the servers and the out files includes the
       server messages. For every channel and every nick name  there  will  be
       new in and out files.  The basic idea of this is to be able to communi‐
       cate with an IRC server with basic command line tools.  For example  if
       you  will join a channel just do echo "/j #channel" > in and ii creates
       a new channel directory with in and out file.

       --ss _s_e_r_v_e_r_n_a_m_e
              lets you override the default servername (irc.freenode.net)

       --pp _p_o_r_t
              lets you override the default port (6667)

       --kk _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e
              lets  you specify an environment variable that contains your IRC
              password, e.g. IIPASS="foobar" ii -k FOOBAR.  This  is  done  in
              order to prevent other users from eavesdropping the server pass‐
              word via the process list.

       --ii _p_r_e_f_i_x
              lets you override the default irc path (~/irc)

       --nn _n_i_c_k_n_a_m_e
              lets you override the default nick ($USER)

       --ff _r_e_a_l_n_a_m_e
              lets you specify your real name associated with your nick

       _~_/_i_r_c  In this directory the irc tree will be created. In  this  direc‐
              tory  you  will  find  a  directory  for  your  server (default:
              irc.freenode.net) in which the FIFO and the output file will  be
              stored.   If you join a channel a new directory with the name of
              the channel will be created in the ~/irc/$servername/ directory.


CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
       _/_a [<message>]
              mark yourself as away

       _/_j #channel/nickname [<message>]
              join a channel or open private conversation with user

       _/_l #channel/nickname
              leave a channel or query

       _/_n nick
              change the nick name

       _/_t topic
              set the topic of a channel

       Everything which is not a command will simply be posted into the  chan‐
       nel or to the server.
              So  if  you need /who just write /WHO as described in the RFC to
              the server in FIFO.

       _o_u_t _f_i_l_e _u_s_a_g_e
              Write wrappers, pagers or use your tools of  choice  to  display
              the out file contents (loco, multitail, etc.).
